	abstract = {We use administrative records on the incomes of more than 40 million children and their parents to describe three features of intergenerational mobility in the United States. First, we characterize the joint distribution of parent and child income at the national level. The conditional expectation of child income given parent income is linear in percentile ranks. On average, a 10 percentile increase in parent income is associated with a 3.4 percentile increase in a child{\textquoteright}s income. Second, intergenerational mobility varies substantially across areas within the U.S. For example, the probability that a child reaches the top quintile of the national income distribution starting from a family in the bottom quintile is 4.4\% in Charlotte but 12.9\% in San Jose. Third, we explore the factors correlated with upward mobility. High mobility areas have (1) less residential segregation, (2) less income inequality, (3) better primary schools, (4) greater social capital, and (5) greater family stability. While our descriptive analysis does not identify the causal mechanisms that determine upward mobility, the publicly available statistics on
intergenerational mobility developed here can facilitate research on such mechanisms.},

   pages = {920-925},
   abstract = {Working from home has become standard for employees with a university degree. The most common scheme, which has been adopted by around 100 million employees in Europe and North America, is a hybrid schedule, in which individuals spend a mix of days at home and at work each week1,2. However, the effects of hybrid working on employees and firms have been debated, and some executives argue that it damages productivity, innovation and career development3–5. Here we ran a six-month randomized control trial investigating the effects of hybrid working from home on 1,612 employees in a Chinese technology company in 2021–2022. We found that hybrid working improved job satisfaction and reduced quit rates by one-third. The reduction in quit rates was significant for non-managers, female employees and those with long commutes. Null equivalence tests showed that hybrid working did not affect performance grades over the next two years of reviews. We found no evidence for a difference in promotions over the next two years overall, or for any major employee subgroup. Finally, null equivalence tests showed that hybrid working had no effect on the lines of code written by computer-engineer employees. We also found that the 395 managers in the experiment revised their surveyed views about the effect of hybrid working on productivity, from a perceived negative effect (−2.6% on average) before the experiment to a perceived positive one (+1.0%) after the experiment. These results indicate that a hybrid schedule with two days a week working from home does not damage performance.},

   title = {Rewinding Back into the Old Normal: Why is Return-to-Office Stressing Employees Out?},
   journal = {Employee Responsibilities and Rights Journal},
   abstract = {Due to the COVID-19 crisis, many professionals embraced remote and hybrid work as the norm. While going back to working in the physical office spaces may seem like returning to normal, it is crucial to understand that this adjustment can be a major cause of stress for some employees. This research aims to explore numerous aspects of return-to-office stress and how organisations may help employees navigate the challenges of a post-pandemic workplace. The authors conducted 29 semi-structured interviews using a purposive sampling technique to understand the analytical viewpoints of the functional managers in the Information Technology (I.T.) sector regarding return-to-office stress. Additionally, content and thematic analysis were performed, which led to the emergence of 4 themes regarding the stress experienced by employees in the I.T. sector on account of return-to-work mandates. Increased work-family conflicts, emotional exhaustion and the rising tendency of presenteeism have emerged as prominent factors in the light of return-to-office stress. The results also highlight that psychological detachment from work can be a significant organisational intervention that can assist employees in coping with return-to-office stress. This study provides an in-depth understanding of the Person-Environment (P-E) fit dynamics within the framework of the Theory of Work Adjustment (TWA) by advancing the comprehension of the manner in which individuals cope with adjustments at work, especially in the context of return-to-work mandates. The study also broadens the awareness of the emotional implications of return-to-office stress by exploring the crucial implications for businesses that want to help employees acclimatise to going back to working in an office once again.},

abstract = {Intergenerational social mobility in the United States has declined over the last century, sparking a national debate about how to improve equality of opportunity. By analyzing data spanning the 20th century, we demonstrate strong temporal patterns operating across regions. Some areas of the United States have witnessed significant declines in social mobility, while others have had persistent low levels all along. Thus, the contemporary national picture is shaped by both powerful forces of change that reduce intergenerational mobility in some regions and deeply entrenched long-term forces generating persistence in others. It follows that improving social mobility will be challenging, as policy would need to respond to both forces and do so according to their varying mixture across different regions. New evidence shows that intergenerational social mobility—the rate at which children born into poverty climb the income ladder—varies considerably across the United States. Is this current geography of opportunity something new or does it reflect a continuation of long-term trends? We answer this question by constructing data on the levels and determinants of social mobility across American regions over the 20th century. We find that the changing geography of opportunity-generating economic activity restructures the landscape of intergenerational mobility, but factors associated with specific regional structures of interpersonal and racial inequality that have “deep roots” generate persistence. This is evident in the sharp decline in social mobility in the Midwest as economic activity has shifted away from it and the consistently low levels of opportunity in the South even as economic activity has shifted toward it. We conclude that the long-term geography of social mobility can be understood through the deep roots and changing economic fortunes of places.}}
